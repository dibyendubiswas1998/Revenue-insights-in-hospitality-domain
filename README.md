# Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain:

## Problem Statement:
* AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
* Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its 
market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

## Important Matrix: 

* **Occupancy %:** The number of rooms occupied by guests. It can be measured on any given night or over a specific period of time such as a month or year. A hotel’s daily occupancy rate is calculated by dividing the number of rooms occupied that night by the total number of rooms in the hotel, then multiplying by   100 to get a percentage.
    
* **Cancellation %:** How many percentage rooms are cancelled over booked rooms.

* **Realization %:** Simply, how many percentage rooms are actually used or occupied by customers.

* **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** A hotel’s average daily rate is the average price guests pay for rooms. A hotel’s average daily rate is calculated by dividing the room revenue for that day by the number of rooms sold that day. 

* **RevPAR (revenue Per Available Rooms):** Revenue per available room (RevPAR) is the average amount of room revenue generated per available room in a hotel property. A hotel’s daily RevPAR is calculated by dividing the hotel’s total room revenue on that night by the total number of rooms available to sell – whether or not they were sold.

* **LOS (Length of Stay):** It means, How many days customers are stayed in rooms.

* **ALOS (Average Length of Stay):** A hotel’s average length of stay (ALOS) is the number of nights guests stay on average over a given period of time, typically a month or year.

* **RevPOR (Revenue Per Occupied Rooms):** Revenue per available room (RevPAR) is the average amount of room revenue generated per occupied room in a hotel property and cross-selling some products to customers.

* **SRN (Sellable Room Nights):** SRN means how many rooms are ready to sale entier month. Suppose you have 100 rooms in your hotel, and you have no issues in your hotel’s rooms, then in month of June (June month have 30 days), you have (30 x 100) = 3000 rooms to sale in entire month (every night). (3000 rooms sellable for June)

* **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** DSRN means how many rooms are ready to sale per day. Suppose you have 100 rooms in your hotel, and you have no issues in your hotel’s rooms,
In month of June (June month have 30 days), you have (30 x 100) = 3000 rooms to sale every night. And your DSRN will be (30 x 100) / 30 = 100.


* **DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):** DBRN means, how many rooms are booked by customer in one night.

* **DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):** DURN means, how many rooms are occupied by customer in a night.
